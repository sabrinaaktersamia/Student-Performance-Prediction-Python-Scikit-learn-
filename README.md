Project Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict student academic performance based on various academic and behavioral factors. The goal is to identify key features that influence student success and provide data-driven insights using predictive modeling.

🧠 Problem Statement

Educational institutions often need early indicators to identify students who may require academic support. This project aims to predict student performance using historical data, helping educators make informed decisions.
